# Hython

A little language with Python-like grammer.

The design borrows quite a lot from language-python and berp.
Forgive me as this is the first time I employ alex and happy, and the principles of compiler design
is still intelligible to me.

## Hackage Dependencies

ghc, alex, happy, cmdargs, data-lens, data-lens-template

## Supporting Features

So far, only three types are supported: None, Integer and Bool.
Only one kind of assignment (plain) is implemented.

Check out `tests/` to find out all features.
